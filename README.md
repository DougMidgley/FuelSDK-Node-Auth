Fuel Auth (for Node.js) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ExactTarget/Fuel-Node-Auth.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ExactTarget/Fuel-Node-Auth)
=============

This library allows users to create authentication clients for ExactTarget APIs.

Use our [REST][1] and [SOAP][2] clients to interact with these APIs at a low-level.

This library is compatible with node versions 0.8 and 0.10+. `npm install` will error if you're using node version 0.8 with developer dependencies. To have a successful install for testing/contributing use `npm install -g npm@1.2.8000` and the issue should be resolved.

## Accessing ExactTarget's API

This is a new library and requires extensive testing. Feel free to test it out and submit issues as they are found.

```
npm install fuel-auth --save
```
